If the ammo meter is null, it means the no. to bullets is zero.
A board with a plus sign is to increase the life of the player, which gets reduced upon getting shot by the enemies.
The green scale means the life period of the player.
The number of grenades left is also visible on the screen.
When the player is dead, a restart option pops-up on the screen.
